      This project was definitely a bit of a doozy. I was assigned to create any sort of interactive toy or tool utilizing javascript. It was also my first time doing a real deep dive into how javascript works which was exceptionally tricky to figure out.

      In short, my project was a productivity timer that instead of showing a numerical timer counting down, used the stages of a plant growing to show time progressing.

      To break down the steps a little bit more, users would be shown a randomized 2x2 grid of various seeds they could choose from. The seeds would then be "planted" into a flower pot. Then users would be given the option to input a time and start the timer.
    </p>
    
      <p class="body">
      Behind the scenes, the computer would then take whatever was input by the user, convert all the time into milliseconds and then divide that number by 4. The divide by 4 is really important as it then starts a repeating interval that occurs every instance of that time, effectively sectioning the users time into 4 segments. Thus, every segment the computer then replaces the image of the plant to a later one in the stage to show the progression of time.

      While this may seem like a relatively inaccurate timer (say you put in 20 minutes, you would only be notified by 5 min progressions), this is by design. I feel with timers that numbers counting down can create a lot of emotional pressure. This timer is meant to be a much friendlier approach to showing time progressing. However, there are somethings I would like to improve about the design. For one, just in general there are a couple of positioning errors with the elements. Also, hitting "reset" breaks the timer completely and the only way to make a new timer is to refresh the page.

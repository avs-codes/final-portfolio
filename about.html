      This was my first foray into making my own unique page with HTML and CSS. It was meant to be just the 'about me' section of a portfolio website. As you can see, the visual direction for my portfolio has changed quite significantly since this iteration.

      In addition to my coding class, I was also taking a class on extended reality (think VR and the like). In that class, I learned about a javascript library called A-Frame that allows me to easily embed 3-D VR experiences onto any webpage. Thus, to practice a bit more with the platform I decided to use it on this page.

      The page layout is actually quite simple with just a fixed header at the top and a single column of items down the center. The main difficulties here was just getting the header at the top to stay in a fixed position as you scroll down the page. Eventually though I was able to figure it out and have it be imposed over the other content

      The A-Frame content is actually a lot easier than it would first seem. Once the library is imported into the HTML, the language and logic for defining the object is fairly straight forward. All I had to do was just define the canvas, define the octahedron, and then give it a rotation animation. The one downside, however, to A-Frame is that it is intended primarily for WebVR applications. Thus, a small "VR" button appears at the bottom of the canvas which I couldn't figure out how to get rid of.

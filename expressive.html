      For expressive text, the goal was to create a website that took a written text and made it interactive. The interactions were limited to simple CSS events like hovers and mouseclicks.

      I chose the song "Lifesaver" by Guru and attempted to highlight the meaning of the first chorus and verse and play around with the idea of censorship. The page uses primarily CSS hover events to bring out the lyrical and rhythmic qualities of Guru's rhymes. The page as a whole also takes a lot of visual inspiration from the album cover the song is from, "Jazzmatazz Vol. 2: The New Reality".

      Guru, in his lyrics, is often philosophical and introspective which is the main focus this piece. In this particular song, Guru looks a lot at the strive for power and the violence that comes with it. He also speaks a lot to the lies and deceptions that are forced onto us by those who have power. Thus, I got the idea to play with blotting out the text that is only then revealed when the user hovers over the bar.

      This is an idea that Guru brings up later in the song where he says "When I lead you to the water / you best know how to swim across". Similarly, I place the bars directly in front of the user but they are the ones who have to cross the border.
    </p>

      Overall I greatly enjoyed being able to work on this project. I was amazed at the level of visual depth that I was able to get just with basic CSS transitions alone. Lifesaver is also a favorite of mine and I was happy to memorialize it in this way.
